# Reiverr

Reiverr is a project that aims to create a single UI for interacting with TMDB, Jellyfin, Radarr and Sonarr, as well as be an alternative to Overseerr.

This project is still in alpha, and many features are still missing. Contributions are welcome! See [contributing](#Contributing) for more information.

Radarr & Sonarr API keys can be found under Settings > General in their respective web UIs. Jellyfin API key is located under Administration > Dashboard > Advanced > API Keys in the Jellyfin Web UI.

# Contributing

Unlike the most Servarr projects, this one is built with Svelte and SvelteKit. If you haven't used Svelte before, don't worry, this was my first Svelte project too. I'd recommend reading the official [Svelte tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte) to get started.

To see a list of missing features & known bugs that you can help with, see [Reiverr Taskboard](https://github.com/users/aleksilassila/projects/5). Feel free to also create your own issues for bug reports or feature requests, as well as discussions for general questions.

Before you contribute:

- If you are taking on an existing bug or feature ticket, please comment on the issue or mark yourself as an assignee to avoid multiple people working on the same thing.
- If the ticket is vague or missing information, please ask for clarification in the comments.
- UI style must match the rest of the project and it is a good idea to discuss the design beforehand, especially for larger design choices (issues labelled with "design")

I'm not a designer, so if you have any ideas for improving the UI, I'd love to learn about them. If you are a designer and would like to help, contributions are much appreciated!

# Development

To get started with development:

1. Clone the repo
2. Add and populate `.env` file
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`

Alternatively, you can run `docker-compose up`.

Example .env file:

```env
# The PUBLIC_ prefix is required for SvelteKit to expose the variable to the web browser.
# If you are exposing the server to the internet (not recommended), you should use HTTPS.

# Fill in the blanks and change the base URLs to match your setup.

PUBLIC_RADARR_API_KEY=yourapikeyhere
PUBLIC_RADARR_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7878

PUBLIC_SONARR_API_KEY=yourapikeyhere
PUBLIC_SONARR_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8989

PUBLIC_JELLYFIN_API_KEY=yourapikeyhere
PUBLIC_JELLYFIN_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8096
